        <h2>Where should I start?</h2>
        <p>Technically, you could start anywhere. If you have no knowledge of anything, <strong>you might as well start learning about github pages</strong> because it basically supports viewing html, css, and javascript all together in a published website. (Plus, it only takes a short amount of time to get a hang of the basics.)</p>
        <p>Afterward, go ahead and <strong>learn html first</strong> because it sets the website structure that css and javascript will act upon. Once you've laid down the basic structure, <strong>then you can learn css and javascript.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>To note: it generally helps to learn html, css, and javascript in conjunction.</strong> Doing so will teach you to coordinate all three of these things at the same time, which you'll have to do down the line if you want to make more websites. <strong>It just helps to have knowledge in making the basic structure first by using something like html in order to get started.</strong></p>
