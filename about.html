        <p>The main purpose of this website is to test out html/css/js features whilst making something that is meaningful.</p>

        <h2>tragic backstory</h2>
        <p>This website was created on March 28th, 2023, although a little bit of tinkering with github pages was done before this. The reason that this website was created was because the maker of it (I) heard of the opportunity to make a website for a club. The problem was that, usually, hosting websites would cost money. Also, the clubbers expressed that the websites would be preferrably coded from scratch if possible. Github pages seemed like a good and reliable way to make code.</p>
        <p>The problem was that I had never seen github pages before so I had no idea how it worked. In addition, I had minimal knowledge of html, css, and js. I had to go scrounging for tutorials or stack overflow discussions to find out "how to commit changes to repository" and "what is a pull request". So, I thought, as a test, I could compile knowledge that was particularly useful to me whilst making my website. That way, I would actually have something to work with whilst making the website.</p>
        <p>Also, disclaimer: not everything on this website will be correct or the most efficient. I just put what works for me.</p>
