        <h2>About github pages</h2>
        <p>Github pages is a <strong>static website hosting site</strong>. This essentially means that you can't host websites that are <strong>dynamic,</strong> or ones that are automatically updated with information without the developer(s) directly updating the page. Dynamic websites include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sites that involve making transactions</li>
            <li>Blogs</li>
            <li>Calendars</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use github pages to make websites like this one, which aren't updated until the developer(s) make changes.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Types of github pages sites</h2>
        <p>As the <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target = "_blank">official github documentations</a> suggest, there are three types of sites on github pages:</p>
        <h3>User/Organization sites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Only one</strong> of these sites can be made per user.</li>
            <li>They are made using an account named <strong>(username or organization name).github.io</strong>.</li>
            <li>They can be found at <strong>https://(username or organization name).github.io,</strong> unless if the site uses a custom domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project sites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>An unlimited amount</strong> of these sites can be made per user.</li>
            <li>Projects are made in <strong>repositories,</strong> which are places to store files made under a specific user/organization. (More on repositories will be covered later.)</li>
            <li>They can be found at <strong>http(s)://(username or organization name).github.io/(repository),</strong> unless if the site uses a custom domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can choose from these options to make a specific type of site depending on what you want to do with the site.</p>

        <h2>How to make a github pages site</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In order to make a site, you have to have an account first. <strong>If you already have an account, skip this step.</strong><br>Go to <a href = https://github.com/ target = "_blank">github.com</a> and follow the instructions found when clicking the "sign up" button on the top right hand corner.</li><br>
            <li>By now you should have a github account.
