        <h2 id = "site-types">Types of github pages sites</h2>
        <p>As the <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target = "_blank">official github documentations</a> suggest, there are three types of sites on github pages:</p>
        <h3>User/Organization sites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Only one</strong> of these sites can be made per user.</li>
            <li>They are made using an account named <strong>(username or organization name).github.io</strong>.</li>
            <li>They can be found at <strong>https://(username or organization name).github.io,</strong> unless if the site uses a custom domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project sites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>An unlimited amount</strong> of these sites can be made per user.</li>
            <li>Projects are made in <strong>repositories,</strong> which are places to store files made under a specific user/organization. (More on repositories will be covered later.)</li>
            <li>They can be found at <strong>http(s)://(username or organization name).github.io/(repository),</strong> unless if the site uses a custom domain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can choose from these options to make a specific type of site depending on what you want to do with the site.</p>

        <h2>How to make a github pages site</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In order to make a site, you have to have an account first. <strong>If you already have an account, skip this step.</strong><br>Go to <a href = https://github.com/ target = "_blank">github.com</a> and follow the instructions found when clicking the "sign up" button on the top right hand corner.</li><br>
            <li>By now you should have a github account. In order to create a site, you must create a <strong>repository,</strong> or a specific place for storing data/files.<br>Create the repository by clicking the plus sign next to your profile picture on the top right hand corner of the screen and then clicking <strong>"New repository".</strong></li>
            <br>
            <img src = "../images/img1.png" alt = "Img to Create Repository">
            <p><strong>Make sure to <a href = "#site-types">check out the different site types </a> to know what you want to make before reading below.</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>making a user/organization site:</h3>
                    <img src = "../images/img2.png" alt = "Img to Create User/Org Size">
                    <p>Once you've clicked "New repository", the first thing you need to do is enter a repository name. <strong>Enter (username or organization name).github.io</strong>, as shown in the image.</p>
                    <p>You can also choose to add a <strong>README file</strong>, which is a file where you can describe your repository to people who are looking at your code, but you don't have to.</p>
                    <p>You could also add a <strong>.gitignore file or license file,</strong> but you're probably only going to use those if you have more experience using github pages in the future because they deal with more advanced topics.</p>
                    <p>If you want your website to be publicly viewable (as in, you can search up for it), make it <strong>public.</strong> If you want to choose who can see it, make it <strong>private.</strong></p></li>
                <li>
                    <h3>making a project site:</h3>
                    <img src = "../images/img3.png" alt = "Img to Create User/Org Size">
                    <p>Once you've clicked "New repository", the first thing you need to do is enter a repository name. <strong>You can enter anything as long as it isn't the one mentioned under user/organization sites</strong>, as shown in the image.</p>
                    <p>You can also choose to add a <strong>README file</strong>, which is a file where you can describe your repository to people who are looking at your code, but you don't have to.</p>
                    <p>You could also add a <strong>.gitignore file or license file,</strong> but you're probably only going to use those if you have more experience using github pages in the future because they deal with more advanced topics.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>special third option:</h3>
                    <img src = "../images/img4.png" alt = "Img to Create User/Org Size">
                    <p>Once you've clicked "New repository", the first thing you need to do is enter a repository name. <strong>If you only enter the name of your account, you will get a special message</strong>, as shown in the image.</p>
                    <p>This third option allows you to make something like an <strong>about me page</strong> linked to your github account. If you do what the special message says, your repository will have a <strong>README file</strong> to insert your information in.</p>
                    <p>You could also add a <strong>.gitignore file or license file,</strong> but I don't know why you'd need that for an about me page.</p>
                    <p>I don't really know what making the repository <strong>private</strong> would do. You can try it out I guess.</p></li>
